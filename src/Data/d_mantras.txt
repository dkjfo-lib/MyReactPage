Ибо мир хороший и Бог хороший
все что остается это тебе быть хорошим

For the World is good and the God is good
the only thing remaining is for yourself to be good

"Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years.
Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good"

"Let no act be done without a purpose" - Marcus

Keep your life simple and do not endue in pleasures
For death and old age will conquer your soul some day

"Take away your opinion and then there is taken away the complaint, "I have been harmed".
Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed", and the harm is taken away"
- Marcus

Do not let thoughts about past or future distract you, for neither exists.
The only thing you have is present and thus, use it and enjoy it

Keep your thoughts simple and let them have purpose.
Do not think what others say or think
for life is an opinion, and it is up to you to have your own

Just like there are junk food there are junk thoughts and feelings
It is up to you what thoughts you are choosing to thinking,
what feelings you are allowing yourself to feel

- I can't see a way through
- Can you see your next step
- Yeah
- Then just take that ❤️

Do not be afraid to go slowly
Be afraid of standing still
- My grandpa Boris

The greatest mistake a man can make is to be afraid of making one
A man makes an attempt, misses his target, understands his mistake and tries again correcting his actions
You can not correct your actions without acting first<br />
