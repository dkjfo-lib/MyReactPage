            Ибо мир хороший и Бог хороший 
            все что остается это тебе быть хорошим
            
            For the World is good and the God is good 
            the only thing remaining is for yourself to be good

            "Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years.
            Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good"

            "Let no act be done without a purpose" - Marcus

            Keep your life simple and do not endue in pleasures
            For death and old age will conquer your soul some day

            "Take away your opinion and then there is taken away the complaint, "I have been harmed". 
            Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed", and the harm is taken away"
            - Marcus 

            Do not let thoughts about past or future distract you, for neither exists.
            The only thing you have is present and thus, use it and enjoy it

            Keep your thoughts simple and let them have purpose. 
            Do not think what others say or think 
            for life is an opinion, and it is up to you to have your own
