        Ибо мир хороший и Бог хороший<br />
        все что остается это тебе быть хорошим
        <br /><br />
        For the World is good and the God is good<br />
        the only thing remaining is for yourself to be good
        <br /><br />
        "Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years.<br />
        Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good"
        <br /><br />
        "Let no act be done without a purpose" - Marcus
        <br /><br />
        Keep your life simple and do not endue in pleasures<br />
        For death and old age will conquer your soul some day
        <br /><br />
        "Take away your opinion and then there is taken away the complaint, "I have been harmed".<br />
        Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed", and the harm is taken away"<br />
        - Marcus
        <br /><br />
        Do not let thoughts about past or future distract you, for neither exists.<br />
        The only thing you have is present and thus, use it and enjoy it
        <br /><br />
        Keep your thoughts simple and let them have purpose.<br />
        Do not think what others say or think<br />
        for life is an opinion, and it is up to you to have your own
        <br /><br />
        Just like there are junk food there are junk thoughts and feelings<br />
        It is up to you what thoughts you are choosing to thinking,<br />
        what feelings you are allowing yourself to feel
        <br /><br />
        - I can't see a way through<br />
        - Can you see your next step<br />
        - Yeah<br />
        - Then just take that ❤️<br />

        Do not be afraid to go slowly<br />
        Be afraid of standing still<br />
        - My grandpa Boris
        <br /><br />
        The greatest mistake a man can make is to be afraid of making one<br />
        A man makes an attempt, misses his target, understands his mistake and tries again correcting his actions<br />
        You can not correct your actions without acting first<br />
